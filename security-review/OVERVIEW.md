Steggy Security Review Overview

Steggy is a client-side steganographic framework designed to embed structured payloads into images for offline or constrained communication scenarios.

Steggy operates entirely within the user’s browser and does not require network connectivity, accounts, servers, or trusted third parties.

Intended Use

Steggy is intended for:
	•	Journalists
	•	Researchers
	•	Human rights workers
	•	Technologists operating in restricted environments
	•	Individuals requiring controlled obfuscation of information

Non-Goals

Steggy does not aim to provide:
	•	Anonymity
	•	Undetectability
	•	Messaging infrastructure
	•	Real-time communication
	•	Protection against device compromise

Steggy should be understood as a tool for controlled data hiding, not a complete security solution.
