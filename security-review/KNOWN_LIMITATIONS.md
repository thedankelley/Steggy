Known Limitations

Steggy has known and intentional limitations.

Steganographic Limitations
	•	LSB embedding is statistically detectable
	•	High-capacity embedding increases detectability
	•	Image reuse increases risk
	•	Lossy image processing may destroy payloads

Cryptographic Limitations
	•	Password strength depends on user choice
	•	PGP key handling relies on user discipline
	•	No automatic key exchange or verification

Transport Limitations
	•	SSTV transport is observable
	•	SSTV provides no confidentiality
