# Steggy ステギー

Steggy is a privacy focused Progressive Web App that enables users to embed information inside image files using steganography, encryption, and integrity verification.

It is designed for journalists, researchers, activists, and individuals who must communicate or transport information in environments where traditional encrypted messaging may be monitored or restricted.

## Design Philosophy

Steggy does not focus on conversations.

It focuses on objects.

By embedding sensitive information inside ordinary images, Steggy allows data to move through existing systems without accounts, servers, or identifiable communication patterns.

This reduces metadata exposure and gives users direct control over how their information is concealed and shared.

## Features

- LSB pixel embedding with randomized scatter
- PNG tEXt chunk insertion architecture
- Multi payload framing
- Payload integrity verification
- Capacity estimation
- Optional AES GCM encryption

## Use Cases

## Privacy Policy

All processing occurs locally on your device.

Steggy does not transmit, collect, log, or analyze any user data.

## Responsible Use

Users are responsible for understanding applicable laws, risks, and ethical obligations when using steganographic or cryptographic tools.
