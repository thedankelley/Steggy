# Steggy 1.9 ステギー

Steggy is a client-side steganographic framework designed to help journalists,
researchers, and individuals in sensitive environments communicate discreetly
without relying on centralized infrastructure.

Steggy operates entirely in the browser and works offline.

## What Steggy Is

- A tool for hiding structured data inside images
- A framework for experimentation and review
- An offline-capable PWA
- A building block, not a messaging app

## What Steggy Is Not

- Not anonymous
- Not undetectable
- Not a secure messenger
- Not a bypass for surveillance

## Core Features

- LSB image embedding
- AES-GCM encryption
- Decoy payload support
- Corruption detection
- Explicit failure states
- Offline operation
- Experimental SSTV transport

## Ethical Position

Steggy is designed to provide control and transparency.
It does not promise safety where none can be guaranteed.

Read the security-review documents before relying on Steggy.
